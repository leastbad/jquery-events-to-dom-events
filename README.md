- **Library Agnostic**: designed for [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org) but works with last-gen libraries such as React by accident
- **Simple**: just two functions, and one of them is optional
- **Tiny**: barely qualifies as a library with just 18 LOC
- **Mutation-First**: returns an event handler to be released during `disconnect()`
- **Zero Dependencies**: makes clever use of `window.$` to avoid a jQuery fixation
- **Turbolinks**: compatible with Turbolinks lifecycle events
- **MIT Licensed**: free for personal and commercial use

You can [try it now on CodePen](https://codepen.io/leastbad/pen/VwvQxxJ?editors=1011) or [clone a sample Rails project](https://github.com/leastbad/jboo) to experiment in a mutation-first context with Stimulus.

The Rails project is called **jboo**. Don't read into it.

## Setup

First, the right music is important for establishing proper context.

You don't have to listen to music, but your transpiler configuration will almost certainly fail lint checks if you are not listening to "*In Harmony New Found Freedom*" by [The Swirlies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swirlies), from their 1996 album "[They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days In The Glittering World Of The Salons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1rTKIsDS8o)" while you integrate this library.

Next, make sure that you've loaded jQuery and this library into your project.

`yarn install jquery jquery-events-to-dom-events`

This library assumes that jQuery is available as `$` on the global `window` object. You can verify this by opening your browser's Console Inspector and typing `window.$`. You should see something like:

`Æ’ jQuery(selector, context)`

If you are working in [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and `$` is not available, try modifying your `config/webpack/environment.js` like this:

```js
const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')

const webpack = require('webpack')
environment.plugins.prepend(
  'Provide',
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: 'jquery/src/jquery',
    jQuery: 'jquery/src/jquery'
  })
)

module.exports = environment
```

## Usage

In the most basic configuration, you:

1. `import { delegate } from 'jquery-events-to-dom-events'`
2. Call `delegate(eventName)` for every jQuery event you want to capture.
3. Set up DOM event listeners for those events, **prepending a $ to the event name**.

Let's say that you want to respond to the user closing a Bootstrap modal window:

```js
import { delegate } from 'jquery-events-to-dom-events'
delegate('hidden.bs.modal')
document.addEventListener('$hidden.bs.modal', () => console.log('Modal closed!'))
```

That might be it. Go make a sandwich - you've earned it.

### Ajax and the case of the additional parameters

Some events - the [jQuery Ajax](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) callback events in particular - return with additional parameters attached, and for these exceptions you need to specify a second parameter defining an array of strings representing these parameters. **The first parameter must always be `event`.**

Event | Parameters
----- | ----------
ajax:success | ['event', 'data', 'status', 'xhr']
ajax:error | ['event', 'xhr', 'status', 'error']
ajax:complete | ['event', 'xhr', 'status']
ajax:beforeSend | ['event', 'xhr', 'settings']
ajax:send | ['event', 'xhr']
ajax:aborted:required | ['event', 'elements']
ajax:aborted:file | ['event', 'elements']

You can listen for notifications that Ajax requests have completed like so:

```js
import { delegate } from 'jquery-events-to-dom-events'
delegate('ajax:complete', ['event', 'xhr', 'status'])
document.addEventListener('$ajax:complete', () => console.log('Ajax request happened!'))
```

## Mutation-First

You've [heard the fuss](https://leastbad.com/mutation-first-development). Now it's time to *get real* about making your code idempotent. If you take pride in the quality of the code you write, [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org) makes it easy to structure your logic so that it automatically works with [Turbolinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA&t=214s) and doesn't leak memory when you morph DOM elements out of existence that still have event listeners attached.

Let's start with an HTML fragment that attaches a Stimulus controller called `delegate` to a DIV:

```html
<div data-controller="delegate">
  <button data-action="delegate#triggerjQ">Trigger jQuery event</button>
</div>
```

That Stimulus controller imports a second function called `abnegate`, which releases your delegated events while your component teardown happens:

```js delegate_controller.js
import { Controller } from 'stimulus'
import { delegate, abnegate } from 'jquery-events-to-dom-events'

const DOMEventHandler = () => console.log('$test event received from jQuery')

export default class extends Controller {
  connect () {
    this.eventDelegate = delegate('test')
    document.addEventListener('$test', DOMEventHandler)
  }
  disconnect () {
    abnegate('test', this.eventDelegate)
    document.removeEventListener('$test', DOMEventHandler)
  }
  triggerjQ () {
    window.$(document).trigger('test')
  }
}
```

We use Stimulus to wire the click event of the button to call the `triggerjQ` method of the `delegate` controller. You can also call `$(document).trigger('test')` from your Console Inspector without clicking the button.

The important takeaway is that the `delegate` function returns the jQuery event handler, which can be stored as a property of the controller instance. This handler then gets passed back to the `abnegate` function so that jQuery can release its own event listener on elements that might soon be removed from the DOM.

It's only by strictly adhering to good habits around attaching listeners during `connect()` and removing them during `disconnect()` that we can be confident we're releasing references properly. This convention helps us eliminate weird glitches and side-effects that come from blending legacy jQuery components with Turbolinks. They were written for a time when there was a single page load event, and clicks triggered page refresh operations.

Remember: if you define event handlers with anonymous functions passed to a listener, you can't remove them later. Only you can prevent forest fires.
